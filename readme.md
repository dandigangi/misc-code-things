# Misc Code Things

Code snippets, minor projects, interview problems, and lessons for the community. These mini projects have served me in my day-to-day. Regex especially.

**NOTE**: Some of the examples were made for the purposes of teaching at a software engineering bootcamp. Some code/explanations may be more simplified or naive in nature. This repo is not a full representation of my skill level.
