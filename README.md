# Regex

Miscellaneus regex I write as I'm doing things at work and on the side to make my life easier.

This will be a slow roll adding to but hopefully it helps you. I'll leave comments on what I add.

## How I Learned Regex

I'd be lying if I said I was a pro but I know enough to be dangerous w/ it along with `bash`, `awk`, and `sed`. Shoutout to the help I've been given over the years by DevOps who are the real pros.

Originally I learned installing SSLs on Wordpress sites since you had to manage URLs frequently. It's very trial and error but it forced me to figure it out.

(Regex101)[https://regex101.com] is an excellent site to build your experiences. It has all the rules in a dictionary + real time breakdown of what your solution is doing. The areas I'm still working on is more complex look aheads/behinds. There's plenty of expressions I still can't read even with a breakdown. If you want to see some wild expressions look up RFCs for things like email address validation. Some are generated by something like Perl but the expressions that they have to write to combine them is nothing short of complex.
