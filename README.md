# Regex

Miscellaneus regex I write as I'm doing things at work and on the side to make my life easier.

This will be a slow roll adding to but hopefully it helps you. I'll leave comments on what I add.

## How I Learned Regex

I'd be lying if I said I was a pro but I know enough to be dangerous w/ it along with `bash`, `awk`, and `sed`. Shoutout to the help I've been given over the years by DevOps who are the real pros.

Originally  I learned installing SSLs on Wordpress sites since you had to manage URLs frequently. It's very trial and error but what really pushed me was using (Regex101)[https://regex101.com].
